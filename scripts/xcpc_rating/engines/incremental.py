"""Incremental ladder rating engine (the single scoring rule).

Everyone starts at 1400; the displayed score is the internal expected
performance ``E`` itself. Per contest the rating takes one bounded step toward
the performance the player achieved, so old results fade geometrically (each
update keeps ``1 - K`` of the past) rather than being dropped, and a single
number fully describes a player.

The rules (one line of the update each)
---------------------------------------
* **Internal expectation** ``E`` starts at ``INITIAL_EXPECT`` (1400). Everything
  field-related uses ``E``: LSE team strength, seeds / performance inversion
  (shared :mod:`xcpc_rating.perf`), predicted ranks, and ``predict_scores``.
* **Update**: ``E += K * tier_weight * (perf - E)`` -- a bounded step toward this
  contest's performance, scaled by the tier prestige weight.
* **CF-pure performance**: every rank's performance comes from the shared
  geometric-mean inversion (the Codeforces formula); the bounded K-step keeps a
  favourite's championship performance from running away.
* **达预期不扣分**: a team whose actual rank <= pre-contest predicted rank has its
  step floored at 0 -- meeting or beating expectation never deducts. Champions
  always qualify; under-performers take the full signed step.
* **Anti-inflation injection**: after the raw steps, the whole field is shifted
  uniformly so the contest nets the tier's target (``TIER_NET_TARGET``). A
  provincial nets 0 -- strictly zero-sum, so the mean stays at 1400 and merely
  meeting expectation breaks even -- while regionals / invitationals / finals
  inject net points, making a higher-prestige tier worth more over a season.
* **Eligibility gates**: a provincial contest only counts for players whose
  pre-contest ``E`` is below the provincial gate, an invitational below the
  invitational gate; regionals and finals are unrestricted. A gated-out row
  changes nothing (no step, no rated-contest count) but stays visible with its
  performance. ``contests`` counts rated contests; ``played`` counts all
  participation (the public 场次).
* **Display**: the displayed score is the raw ``E`` itself (a fresh player shows
  1400). Expectation and prediction use the same ``E``.

Geometric forgetting is built into the update, so nothing is ever deleted; an
optional idle-decay term regresses a long-idle ``E`` toward the prior.
