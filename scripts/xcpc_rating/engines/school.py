"""School rating engine — Bayesian, zero-sum update over each contest's 校排.

The competitor is a **school**, and the rating is a Bayesian running mean of the
levels it has played at among schools — **not** the player ladder. Two properties
the player ladder lacks and the user wants:

* **Bayesian / stable.** The step toward a contest's performance uses a
  *decreasing* learning rate ``1 / (KAPPA + n)`` (the online posterior-mean update
  of a Normal mean with a ``KAPPA``-strength prior at ``MU0``). So a school's
  rating is its all-history average, and a single extreme contest barely moves a
  seasoned school — no over-reacting to the latest/wildest result.
* **Zero-sum.** After the steps, one uniform shift makes the contest's rating
  changes net to exactly 0 — points are redistributed, never inflated.

Per contest:

1. **School standing.** A school is its single strongest official team that
   contest — the smallest (best) rank among its ``official`` & participating
   rostered rows. Schools are ranked among themselves (1224 ties).
2. **Performance (校排 → perf).** Treat the participating schools as a field with
   their current ratings and feed that field + the school ranks to the shared
   Codeforces-style inversion (:func:`xcpc_rating.perf.compute_performances`):
   the level the school played at among schools (topping a strong, deep field is
   worth more).
3. **Bayesian zero-sum step.** With ``alpha_i = 1 / (KAPPA + n_i)`` (``n_i``
   counting this contest)::

       step_i = alpha_i * (perf_i - rating_i)     # online mean update (shrinks with n)
       inc    = -mean(step)                        # so Σ (step + inc) = 0
       rating_i += step_i + inc

   Performing above your rating rises, below it falls; a veteran moves little, a
   newcomer adapts fast; the field's net change is zero.

Everyone starts at ``MU0`` and the mean stays pinned there (zero-sum), strong
schools above and weak below on the same ~1400–3000 scale as players.
