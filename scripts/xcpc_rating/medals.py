"""Tiered gold / silver / bronze medal accounting from raw srk standings.

Read-only and additive: this module does not touch any scoring rule, the loader's
dedup logic, or :mod:`xcpc_rating.tier`'s classification. It re-reads the original
``*.srk.json`` files, reproduces the medal allocation srk renders, and buckets
every medal by the contest's prestige tier
(:func:`xcpc_rating.tier.classify_tier`).

The medal rule lives in each file's ``series``
----------------------------------------------
Every srk standings file carries a ``series`` array. The medal series is the one
whose ``segments`` carry ``style`` values ``gold`` / ``silver`` / ``bronze``.
Each segment's size is read **per segment** (not as a cumulative cutoff) and
accumulated into cumulative rank endpoints. Two ``rule`` option forms appear:

* ``options.count.value = [g, s, b]`` -- per-segment team counts, accumulated to
  cumulative cutoffs ``[g, g + s, g + s + b]``: gold = positions 1..g, silver =
  the next s, bronze = the next b, over the eligible standings in rank order.
* ``options.ratio.value = [r1, r2, r3]`` -- per-segment fractions. Each segment's
  size is ``ri * denominator`` under the configured rounding
  (``floor`` / ``ceil`` / ``round``, default ``ceil``), accumulated with
  ``Decimal`` to avoid float drift. ``denominator`` is the count of eligible
  teams that *scored* (solved >= 1) when ``ratio.denominator == "scored"``,
  otherwise the full eligible-team count.

``noTied: true`` cuts strictly at the computed position; by default a band is
extended to include every team tied (same solved + penalty) with the team at the
cutoff, so tied teams never split across two colors.

Eligibility (official teams, optional marker filter)
----------------------------------------------------
Medals are allocated only over **official** teams (``user.official`` not False);
a starred / unofficial team is removed from the pool entirely, so an official team
above it moves up into the slot. Some boards carry ``options.filter.byMarker``:
only official teams whose ``user.markers`` list contains that marker id are
eligible (e.g. a final awards medals only to 本科 teams). Teams without the
marker drop out of the pool exactly like a starred team.

ICPC-preset default fallback (zero / missing count)
---------------------------------------------------
An ICPC-preset medal series whose ``count.value`` is absent or ``[0, 0, 0]`` (and
has no ``ratio``) falls back to the ICPC default bands, per segment:
gold = ``ceil(0.1 * n)``, silver = ``2 * gold``, bronze = ``3 * gold``, where
``n`` is the eligible (official + optional marker) pool size. A non-ICPC preset
with a ``[0, 0, 0]`` count (or a ratio rounding to 0) awards nothing.

Public surface
--------------
* :func:`parse_medal_rule` -- one file's per-segment ``[gold, silver, bronze]``
  counts, or ``None`` if it has no medal series.
* :func:`allocate_medals` -- ``{member_key: 'gold'|'silver'|'bronze'}`` for one
  parsed srk dict (coaches dropped, in-contest key dedup).
* :func:`collect_medals` -- scan the in-scope boards (scored boards plus
  duplicate-of provincial copies) and aggregate per member per prestige tier.

Everything here is a pure function over data already on disk; nothing mutates
shared state.

    The scan set is the boards the rating pipeline actually consumes

    * every **scored** contest (``LoadResult.contests``) -- bucketed by its own
      prestige tier (a co-branded "X邀请赛暨Y省赛" classifies as invitational and
      awards its medals over the full field), and
    * every **duplicate-of** provincial copy that dedup dropped
      (``LoadResult.skipped`` entries whose ``reason`` starts with
      ``"duplicate-of:"``), with one critical distinction between a co-branded
      省赛/邀请赛 board and a literal duplicate:

      - a copy that is a **literal duplicate** of its scored source (same
        standings size) is the SAME contest filed twice under both ``ccpc/`` and
        ``provincial/`` -- it is **skipped** so its medals are not double-counted
        (they were already awarded on the scored board);
      - a copy that is a genuine **province-internal subset** (fewer rows than
        its source -- e.g. ``fjcpc12th`` 112 福建 teams vs the 285-team source)
        is the 省赛 sub-ranking, so its medals are awarded in the **provincial**
        tier (distinct from the source's invitational medals over the full field).

    Boards skipped for **low coverage** are excluded (they never enter scoring).

    Returns ``{member_key: {tier: {gold, silver, bronze}}}`` with a uniform
    all-tier shape per member. ``load_result`` may be passed to reuse an existing
    :class:`~xcpc_rating.loader.LoadResult` (avoids a second disk scan).
