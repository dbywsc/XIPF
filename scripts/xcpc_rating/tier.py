"""Contest prestige tiers and their per-contest weights.

Backs the incremental ladder engine (the single scoring rule).

Why a prestige tier
-------------------
The engine recovers each team's performance rating ``R*`` by inverting an
expected-rank equation summed over the whole field
(:func:`xcpc_rating.perf.compute_performances`). ``R*`` therefore scales with
*field size*, not only opponent strength: the biggest fields are the all-comers
provincial / invitational boards (300-500 teams), whose front-runners lap a long
weak tail and so reverse-solve a *higher* ``R*`` than a small all-elite Final
(~120-320 teams). Left uncorrected, prestige and reward invert ("邀请赛涨幅特别大").

A per-contest prestige weight corrects this and encodes the intended ordering
World / EC Final = CCPC final > regional > invitational > provincial.

The four tiers
--------------
* ``final``        -- ICPC World Finals, ICPC (EC) Finals, CCPC national finals.
* ``regional``     -- ordinary ICPC / CCPC regional sites (the 1.0 baseline).
* ``invitational`` -- national invitationals (邀请赛), incl. the Silk Road
                      invitational (srni / 丝绸之路邀请赛).
* ``provincial``   -- provincial-category contests plus the female-only
                      (女生专场) and vocational (高职专场) special tracks
                      (restricted fields regardless of host category).

Classification precedence (first match wins)
--------------------------------------------
1. ``final``        : id contains ``ecfinal``; or id ends with ``final``; or the
                      title contains 总决赛 / a standalone "Final". CCPC
                      ``...final`` and ICPC ``...ecfinal`` ids both land here.
2. ``provincial``   : ``category == 'provincial'``; or a female / vocational
                      special track (``ladies`` / ``female`` / ``girls`` / 女生,
                      or ``hv`` / ``vocational`` / 高职). Placed *before* the
                      invitational check so a 省赛 co-branded as a 全国邀请赛
                      stays provincial.
3. ``invitational`` : id contains ``invitational`` or ``srni``; or the title
                      contains 邀请赛 (non-provincial categories only).
4. ``regional``     : every remaining official ICPC / CCPC site.

:func:`classify_tier` raises ``ValueError`` on a contest that matches no tier,
so a data drift surfaces loudly rather than silently defaulting.
