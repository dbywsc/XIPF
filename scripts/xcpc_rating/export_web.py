"""Static web data exporter for the xcpc-rating data site.

This module turns the incremental-ladder pipeline (``xcpc_rating.engines.
incremental`` -- the single scoring rule, "从 0 起步逐场累积") into the static
JSON bundle the Vite/React frontend consumes. It does **not** touch the scoring
rule: it replays the exact same time-ordered backtest the validator runs,
snapshots per-contest predictions/performances without look-ahead leakage, and
writes the single-board data contract the frontend's ``web/src/lib/data.ts``
mirrors.

Run as a module::

    python -m xcpc_rating.export_web \
        --data vendor/srk-collection/official \
        --out  web/public/data

Pipeline, per contest in chronological order (same order the loader guarantees):

1. **Predict before update (no leakage).** Take the engine's ``predict_scores``
   on the pre-update state, derive a 1-based ``predictedRank`` per team (higher
   score = better = lower rank, stable sort), and the per-contest pairwise
   ``concordance`` via the shared validator function.
2. **Process the contest.** Update the engine's internal state.
3. **Snapshot performances.** The engine appended one raw internal-track perf
   sample per real member (rank-1 teams carry the redefined champion solve); a
   team's perf is read back from any real member's history tail (all members of
   a team share it). Ghost teams (no roster) persist nothing -> ``perf = null``.
4. **Record per-member history rows.** ``rating_after`` is the member's display
   ladder score after this contest; ``mu_after`` is the internal expectation E.

After the full replay the terminal engine state plus the accumulated per-contest
and per-player aggregates are written out as the contract files. JSON is emitted
compact (no spaces); the player index is the array-compressed form; player detail
files are sharded into 256 buckets by the first two hex chars of ``md5(key)``.
